'''
Imagine a telecommunications provider has segmented its customer base by 
service usage patterns, categorizing the customers into four groups. 
If demographic data can be used to predict group membership, the company can 
customize offers for individual prospective customers. It is a classification 
problem. That is, given the dataset, with predefined labels, we need to build 
a model to be used to predict class of a new or unknown case.

The example focuses on using demographic data, such as region, age, 
and marital, to predict usage patterns.

The target field, called custcat, has four possible values that correspond 
to the four customer groups, as follows: 1- Basic Service 2- E-Service 
3- Plus Service 4- Total Service

Our objective is to build a classifier, to predict the class of 
unknown cases. We will use a specific type of classification called 
K nearest neighbour.

##lets load our data

df = pd.read_csv('https://s3-api.us-geo.objectstorage.softlayer.net/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/ML0101ENv3/labs/teleCust1000t.csv')
df.head()


'''Data Visualization and Analysis'''
##Let’s see how many of each class is in our data set
df['custcat'].value_counts()

##You can easily explore your data using visualization techniques:
#df.hist(column='income', bins=50)


'''Feature set'''
##Lets define feature sets, X:
df.columns

##To use scikit-learn library, we have to convert the 
##Pandas data frame to a Numpy array:
X = df[['region', 'tenure','age', 'marital', 'address', 'income', 'ed', 
        'employ','retire', 'gender', 'reside']] .values  #.astype(float)
X[0:5]

##What are our labels?
y = df['custcat'].values
y[0:5]


'''Normalize Data'''
##Data Standardization give data zero mean and unit variance, it is good 
##practice, especially for algorithms such as KNN which is based on distance 
##of cases:

X = preprocessing.StandardScaler().fit(X).transform(X.astype(float))
X[0:5]

Train Test Split
Out of Sample Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions that the 
model makes on data that that the model has NOT been trained on. Doing a 
train and test on the same dataset will most likely have low out-of-sample 
accuracy, due to the likelihood of being over-fit.

It is important that our models have a high, out-of-sample accuracy, 
because the purpose of any model, of course, is to make correct predictions 
on unknown data. So how can we improve out-of-sample accuracy? One way is to 
use an evaluation approach called Train/Test Split. Train/Test Split involves 
splitting the dataset into training and testing sets respectively, which are 
mutually exclusive. After which, you train with the training set and test 
with the testing set.

This will provide a more accurate evaluation on out-of-sample accuracy 
because the testing dataset is not part of the dataset that have been 
used to train the data. It is more realistic for real world problems.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split( X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=4)

print ('Test set:', X_test.shape,  y_test.shape)


'''Classification -- K nearest neighbor (KNN)'''

##Classifier implementing the k-nearest neighbors vote.
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier


'''
Training
Lets start the algorithm with k=4 for now:
'''

k = 6
#Train Model and Predict  
neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = k).fit(X_train,y_train)

'''
Predicting
we can use the model to predict the test set:
'''
yhat = neigh.predict(X_test)
yhat[0:5]

'''
Accuracy evaluation
In multilabel classification, accuracy classification score is a function 
that computes subset accuracy. This function is equal to the 
jaccard_similarity_score function. Essentially, 
it calculates how closely the actual labels and predicted 
labels are matched in the test set.
'''

from sklearn import metrics
print("Train set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_train, neigh.predict(X_train)))
print("Test set Accuracy: ", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat))

'''
What about other K?
K in KNN, is the number of nearest neighbors to examine. It is supposed 
to be specified by the User. So, how can we choose right value for K? 
The general solution is to reserve a part of your data for testing the 
accuracy of the model. Then chose k =1, use the training part for modeling, 
and calculate the accuracy of prediction using all samples in your test set. 
Repeat this process, increasing the k, and see which k is the best for your
model.

We can calculate the accuracy of KNN for different Ks.
'''

Ks = 10
mean_acc = np.zeros((Ks-1))
std_acc = np.zeros((Ks-1))
ConfustionMx = [];
for n in range(1,Ks):
    
    #Train Model and Predict  
    neigh = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = n).fit(X_train,y_train)
    yhat=neigh.predict(X_test)
    mean_acc[n-1] = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, yhat)

    
    std_acc[n-1]=np.std(yhat==y_test)/np.sqrt(yhat.shape[0])

plt.plot(range(1,Ks),mean_acc,'g')
plt.fill_between(range(1,Ks),mean_acc - 1 * std_acc,mean_acc + 1 * std_acc, alpha=0.10)
plt.legend(('Accuracy ', '+/- 3xstd'))
plt.ylabel('Accuracy ')
plt.xlabel('Number of Nabors (K)')

plt.show()
